# The Basics of the Wilson Debate System

The Wilson debate system is based in U.S. national debate tournament standards. These debates are formatted under 4 possible formats.

## Debate Formats

* Lincoln Douglass (LD)
* British Parliamentary (BP)
* World Schools Policy (PD)
* Extempt (EXTMP)

## Judging

As opposed to many other debate systems, our debate system judges debate using a panel of judges. These judges must both be selected, and approved by both debaters before a debate can take place. 
Judges may not display any form of bias towards any single debater, such as providing them with arguments, or prematurely casting your vote in their favour. It is entirely unacceptable for any judge to hold bias in any judgements, and viable evidence could result in a blacklist from our debate system and disqualification of brownie points. 
If a judgement is unable to reach a(n) majority, the winner will be picked at random.

## Scoring

We score our debate system using an Bradley-Terry comparison algorithm similiar to elo. All users start with 1000 Brownie Points, and gain or lose them based on their debate preformance. It is ideal to debate users at a similiar or higher level for maximum point gain. The average point gain per match is about 2.3, however points can be gained at a higher rate from users with higher ratings than yourself. For example, if a user has a brownie point rating of 1000 higher than your own, 1000, then you will gain 11.6 points. The system is equal exchange, so if you lose to a debater at a lower level, you will lose more points. In additiioon, the lagorithm is logarithmic, meaning that you will gain or lose less points as your rating increases.
